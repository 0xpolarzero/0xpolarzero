I'm a software engineer with a strong focus on blockchain/cryptography; seeking to build/contribute to truly useful and accessible consumer products or developer tooling, preferably open-source public goods.

I'm currently obsessing on UX, (onchain) games, AI for user-centric applications, local first apps, among others.
